You are using elm-review <version>.

    elm-review <zero-or-more-files-or-directories>
        Analyzes your project, and lists the locations where patterns forbidden
        by your configuration appear. It can potentially also fix some of the
        errors for you when adding --fix.

        Unless files or directories are specified, elm-review will look at:
        - For packages: src/ and tests/
        - For applications: the project’s elm.json’s "source-directories" and
          tests/

    elm-review init
        Creates an empty review configuration. It creates a review/elm.json and
        a review/src/ReviewConfig.elm file, and provides links to help you get
        started. Learn more by running elm-review init --help.

    elm-review new-package
        Creates an new project aimed to contain rules and to be published later.

    elm-review new-rule [RULE-NAME]
        Adds a new rule to your review configuration or review package.

You can customize the review command with the following flags:

    --watch
        Re-run elm-review automatically when your project changes.
        You can use --watch and --fix together.

    --elmjson <path-to-elm.json>
        Specify the path to the elm.json file of the project. By default,
        the one in the current directory or its parent directories will be used.

    --config <path-to-review-directory>
        Use the review configuration in the specified directory instead of the
        one found in the current directory or one of its parents.

    --template <author>/<repo>[path-to-the-config-folder][#branch-or-commit]
        Use the review configuration from a GitHub repository. You can use this
        to try out elm-review, a configuration or a single rule.
        This flag requires Internet access, even after the first run.
        Examples:
          - elm-review --template author/review-configuration
          - elm-review --template jfmengels/review-unused/example#master

    --compiler <path-to-elm>
        Specify the path to the elm compiler.

    --version
        Print the version of the elm-review CLI.

    --debug
        Add helpful information to debug your configuration or rules.
        - Print the list of reviewed files.
        - Run the compiler in debug mode, allowing you to use Debug statements
          in your configuration and custom rules.

    --no-details
        Hide the details from error reports for a more compact view.

If you wish to use automatic fixing, you can use the following flags:

    --fix
        elm-review will present fixes for the errors that offer an automatic
        fix, which you can then accept or refuse one by one. When there are no
        more fixable errors left, elm-review will report the remaining errors as
        if it was called without --fix.
        Fixed files will be reformatted using elm-format.

    --fix-all
        elm-review will present a single fix containing the application of all
        available automatic fixes, which you can then accept or refuse.
        Afterwards, elm-review will report the remaining errors as if it was
        called without --fix-all.
        Fixed files will be reformatted using elm-format.

    --elm-format-path <path-to-elm-format>
        Specify the path to elm-format.
