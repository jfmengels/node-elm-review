-- MODULE NOT FOUND ------------------------------------------------------------

A module is missing in your configuration. Maybe you forgot to add some
dependencies that contain the rules you wished to enable? If so, run elm install
with the package name from inside
<local-path>/test/config-error-unknown-module.
