-- CONFIGURATION IS EMPTY ------------------------------------------------------

Your configuration contains no rules. You can add rules by editing the ReviewConfig.elm file.

I recommend you take a look at the following documents:
  - How to configure elm-review: https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/#Configuration
  - When to write or enable a rule: https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/#when-to-write-or-enable-a-rule
