-- NO FILES FOUND --------------------------------------------------------------

I was expecting to find Elm files in all the paths that you passed, but I could
not find any in the following directories:
- <local-path>/test/project-with-errors/unknown-target

When I can’t find files in some of the directories, I’m assuming that you
misconfigured the CLI’s arguments.
