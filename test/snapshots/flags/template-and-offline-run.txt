-- COMMAND REQUIRES NETWORK ACCESS ---------------------------------------------

I can't use --template in offline mode, as I need network access to download the
external template.

If you have the configuration locally on your computer, you can run it by
pointing to it with --config.

Otherwise, I recommend you try to gain network access and initialize your
configuration to be able to run it offline afterwards:

    elm-review init --template jfmengels/elm-review-unused/example
