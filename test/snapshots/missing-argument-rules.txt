-- MISSING FLAG ARGUMENT -------------------------------------------------------

The --rules flag needs more information.

Here is the documentation for this flag:

    --rules <rule1,rule2,...>
        Run with a subsection of the rules in the configuration. Specify them
        by their name, and separate them by commas.
