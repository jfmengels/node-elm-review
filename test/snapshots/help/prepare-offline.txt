The prepare-offline command allows the tool to run in offline mode using
the --offline flag.

This will build the review configuration application and download the
dependencies of the project to review. It requires network access.

If you change your the review configuration, you might need to re-run this
command to work again in offline mode.

You can customize the prepare-offline command with the following flags:

    --elmjson <path-to-elm.json>
        Specify the path to the elm.json file of the project. By default,
        the one in the current directory or its parent directories will be used.

    --config <path-to-review-directory>
        Use the review configuration in the specified directory instead of the
        one found in the current directory or one of its parents.

    --compiler <path-to-elm>
        Specify the path to the elm compiler.
