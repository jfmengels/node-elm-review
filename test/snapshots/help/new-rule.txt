The new-rule command adds an empty rule to your review configuration or
review package.

    elm-review new-rule [RULE-NAME]
        It will add a rule file in src/ and a corresponding test file in tests/.
        If this is for a review package, the command will add the rule to the
        list of "exposed-modules" in the elm.json file. It will also add to the
        README.md a description of the rule and add the rule to the example
        configuration.
        If this is for a project with a review/ folder, you need to run this command
        from inside review/.

        RULE-NAME should be formatted just like an Elm module name, such as
        NoDoingThis or No.Doing.This. Read more about good names at
