The new-rule command adds an empty rule to your review configuration or
review package.

    elm-review new-rule [RULE-NAME]
        It will add a rule file in src/ and a corresponding test file in tests/.
        If this is for a review package, the command will add the rule to the
        list of "exposed-modules" in the elm.json file. It will also add to the
        README.md a description of the rule and add the rule to the example
        configuration.
        If this is for a project with a review/ folder, you need to run this command
        from inside review/.

        RULE-NAME should be formatted just like an Elm module name, such as
        NoDoingThis or No.Doing.This. Read more about good names at
        https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/Review-Rule#a-good-rule-name

You can customize the new-rule command with the following flags:

    --rule-type <module|project>
        Whether the starting rule should be a module rule or a project rule.
        Module rules are simpler but look at Elm modules in isolation, whereas
        project rules are more complex but have access to information from the
        entire project. You can always switch from a module rule to a project
        rule manually later on.
