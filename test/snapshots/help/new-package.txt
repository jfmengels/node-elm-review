The new-package command scaffolds a new project to help you publish a package with elm-review rules.

    elm-review new-package
        It will create a new project, containing:
        - An elm.json file
        - A src/ directory with an initial rule
        - A tests/ directory with an initial rule
        - A package.json with Elm tooling and scripts
        - A preconfigured review configuration, tailored for elm-review rules
        - A GitHub action to publish the package really easily

You can customize the new-package command with the following flags:

    --compiler <path-to-elm>
        Specify the path to the elm compiler.
        The elm compiler is used to know the version of the compiler to write
        down in the review/elm.json fileâ€™s `elm-version` field. Use this if you
        have multiple versions of the elm compiler on your device.
