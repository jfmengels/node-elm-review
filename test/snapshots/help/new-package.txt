The new-package command scaffolds a new project to help you publish a package with elm-review rules.

    elm-review new-package
        It will create a new project, containing:
        - An elm.json file
        - A src/ directory with an initial rule
        - A tests/ directory with an initial rule
        - A package.json with Elm tooling and scripts
        - A preconfigured review configuration, tailored for elm-review rules
        - A GitHub action to publish the package really easily

You can customize the new-package command with the following flags:

    --compiler <path-to-elm>
        Specify the path to the elm compiler.
        The elm compiler is used to know the version of the compiler to write
        down in the review/elm.json fileâ€™s `elm-version` field. Use this if you
        have multiple versions of the elm compiler on your device.

    --rule-type <module|project>
        Whether the starting rule should be a module rule or a project rule.
        Module rules are simpler but look at Elm modules in isolation, whereas
        project rules are more complex but have access to information from the
        entire project. You can always switch from a module rule to a project
        rule manually later on.
