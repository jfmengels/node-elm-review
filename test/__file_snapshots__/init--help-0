The init command helps getting started with [92melm-review[39mâ€™s configuration.

    [96melm-review init[39m
        It will ask permission to create several files:
        - [93mreview/elm.json[39m in which you may add dependencies with review rules.
        - [95mreview/src/ReviewConfig.elm[39m to define your configuration.

        After the files have been created, it will provide links to get you
        started.

You can customize the init command with the following flags:

    [36m--config <path-to-review-directory>[39m
        Create the configuration files in the specified directory instead of in
        the review/ directory.

    [36m--template <author>/<repo>[/path-to-the-config-folder][#branch-or-commit][39m
        Copy the review configuration from a GitHub repository, at the root or
        in a folder. Examples:
        - elm-review init --template author/elm-review-configuration
        - elm-review init --template jfmengels/elm-review-unused/example#master

    [36m--compiler <path-to-elm>[39m
        Specify the path to the [95melm[39m compiler.
        The [95melm[39m compiler is used to know the version of the compiler to write
        down in the [93mreview/elm.json[39m fileâ€™s `elm-version` field. Use this if you
        have multiple versions of the [95melm[39m compiler on your device.
