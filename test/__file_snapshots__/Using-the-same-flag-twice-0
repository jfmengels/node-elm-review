[32m-- FLAG USED SEVERAL TIMES -----------------------------------------------------[39m

The [91m--config[39m flag may not be used several times. I need a single value for this flag but I got several, and I don't know which one to choose.

In case it helps, here is the documentation for this flag:

    [36m--config <path-to-review-directory>[39m
        Use the review configuration in the specified directory instead of the
        one found in the current directory or one of its parents.
