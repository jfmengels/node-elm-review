The new-package command scaffolds a new project to help you publish a package with [92melm-review[39m rules.

    [96melm-review new-package[39m
        It will create a new project, containing:
        - An elm.json file
        - A src/ directory with an initial rule
        - A tests/ directory with an initial rule
        - A package.json with Elm tooling and scripts
        - A preconfigured review configuration, tailored for elm-review rules
        - A GitHub action to publish the package really easily

You can customize the new-package command with the following flags:

    [36m--compiler <path-to-elm>[39m
        Specify the path to the [95melm[39m compiler.
        The [95melm[39m compiler is used to know the version of the compiler to write
        down in the [93mreview/elm.json[39m fileâ€™s `elm-version` field. Use this if you
        have multiple versions of the [95melm[39m compiler on your device.
